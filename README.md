# Spark Quick Install

This guide is based on using a Mac. The command to start PySpark with Apache Spark will be different for Mac.

### Part 1: Install Java

1. Navigate to Oracle Community Download Page.
2. Download the appropriate Java 8 Development Kit for your machine.

### Part 2: Install Apache Spark

1. Download Apache Spark from its [website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. Unzip the .tgz file.
3. Open Terminal. Navigate to the folder we just unzipped. The file will most likely be in your Downloads or Desktop folder. For me its my Desktop folder.

`cd Desktop/spark/`

5. Enter the command `./bin/pyspark`
